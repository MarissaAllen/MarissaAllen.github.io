			<p>The Amulet project was in partnership with a team at Dartmouth who are
				designing and developing ‘Amulet’, computational jewelry to monitor a
				person's health. So far the prototype consists of an electronic bracelet
				and a software framework that enables developers to create (and users to
				easily use) safe, secure, and efficient mHealth applications. More info here.</p>

			<p>I was a member of the team that designed the case for the Amulet prototype.
				We went through several iterations, initially using Vectorworks and
				transitioning to Solidworks. One of the biggest challenges in designing
				the case was that we had to design around pre-fabricated boards while
				also trying to reduce the size of the previous design.</p>
