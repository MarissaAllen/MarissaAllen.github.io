			<h2>Foldlings (MS Thesis)</h2>

			<!-- Explain/Brief Description -->
			<p>Foldlings was a joint project where my partner and I created an interactive
				3D pop-up card design app. The user sketches a 2D design and our iPad app
				converts that design into a 3D representation in kirigami pop-up form.
				For this project I was responsible
				for transforming the 2D shapes drawn by the user into 3D planes, rendering
				the interactive 3D simulation that allows the user to pinch to open and close the pop-up card,
				and creating the svg file to send to a laser cutter. <a href="/projects/Foldlings.pdf">My full thesis is here</a>.

			<h3>The Process</h3>
			<!-- Problem, then solution-->
			<p>To create 3D plane objects from user's sketch, we reduce the sketch into
				edges and created a Swift method to follow those edges forming planes using
				the Polygon Walk method. Those planes are then linked together into an acyclic graph which defines
				how each plane behaves in the 3D simulation. After the user is satisfied with
				their card, they can create an svg file to send to a laser cutter and have the
				physical card in seconds. <a href="https://github.com/MarissaAllen/foldlings">Full code here.</a>

			<h3>The GetPlanes Method:</h3>
			<p>This Swift method creates Plane objects that are passed to Scenekit to
				become 3-D planes from 2-D Edge objects by using the Polygon Walk method.
				This function iterates through all the edges connecting endpoints to startpoints until it forms a closed
				shape. There are many constraints including whether the edge has been
				previously visited or if the shape created is just a line. The function
				also sets certain attributes of the newly created Plane object such as the
				 number of folds and the top and
				bottom edges.
