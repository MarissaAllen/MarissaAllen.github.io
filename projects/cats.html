			<p> This is a current project I've been working on using React Native. This is an app that dectects stress and shows the user a fun cat gif to provide a brief distraction and hopefully alieviate stress. In order, to combat the correlation of stress and
				gifs, the app also inserts gifs at random times throughout the day.</p>
