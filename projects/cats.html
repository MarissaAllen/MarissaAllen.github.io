			<p>
			React Giphy Cats is a project I am currently working on using React Native and iOs. The app's goal is to detect user's stress
			and show the user a fun cat gif to provide a brief distraction and hopefully
			alleviate that stress.  To combat possible correlation betweem
			stress and gifs that would undermine the gifs positive effects, the app also inserts gifs at random times throughout the day.
		Progress can be track at <a href="https://github.com/MarissaAllen/CatStressApp">this repo.</a></p>
