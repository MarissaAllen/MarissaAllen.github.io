			<h2>React Giphy Cats</h2>
			<h3>In Progress: Swift, React Native</h3>

			<br>
			<p>
				React Giphy Cats is a project I am currently working on using React Native and iOs. The app's goal is to show the user a fun animal gif, at random times throughout the day, to provide a brief distraction and hopefully alleviate some immediate stress.
				I plan on using <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial">this tutorial</a>, as a guide for development. Code progress can be track at
				<a href="https://github.com/MarissaAllen/CatStressApp">this repo.</a></p>
			<p>The ultimate goal for the project would be to find a way to measure the app's effectiveness and integrate Apple's Healthkit to create a model that detects stress. Ideally, I would combine that model with random gif insertions to combat any correlation
				between gifs and stress.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to better define its purpose, functionality, and how the user interacts with the app, I considered what features I wanted to include in this first round:
				<ul class "dots">
					<li> Show entertaining animal gifs at random times during the day.</li>
					<li> The option to dismiss the app or postpone, if user is busy or doesn't want a distraction.</li>
					<li> A way to change the gifs or see more gifs.</li>
					<li> Timeout feature or cap on number of gifs that will prevent the user from wasting too much time.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Initial Mockups</h3>
			<p>After figuring out how the app will be used, I designed some initial mockups.</p>

			<h3>First step</h3>
			<p>So far, I've added a View to the project and changed a bit of the index.ios.js and included a picture of Caveman the Cat. The next step is to try to display gifs from giphy which requires a study of the giphy api!</p>

			<h3>To Try</h3>
			<p>After reading up on the giphy api and <a href="http://blog.tighten.co/react-101-building-a-gif-search-engine">this tutorial</a>, I have several options in structuring my app. I could call giphy every time the user swipes, I could use the plugin react-giphy
				to make the same call when the user swipes to change gifs, or I could call giphy once and recieve a list of gifs to iterate through when the user swipes.</p>
			<p> I decided, for my first go-around, to try the third option and structure my app in the following way:
				<ul class "dots">
					<li> Create a separate component/class to load all of the gifs into a list</li>
					<li> Use the size of the list to determine the distraction duration</li>
					<li> Use the a separate gifView to view one gif and then iterate through the list</li>
				</ul>
				This should result in quicker iteration through gifs and less wait in-between which suits my needs, because the app should be actively showing gifs for short periodic bursts.
