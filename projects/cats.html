		<p>
			React Giphy Cats is a project I am currently working on using React Native and iOs. The app's goal is to show the user a fun animal gif, at random times throughout the day, to provide a brief distraction and hopefully alleviate some immediate stress.
			I plan on using <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial">this tutorial</a>, as a guide for development. Code progress can be track at
			<a href="https://github.com/MarissaAllen/CatStressApp">this repo.</a></p>
		<p>The ultimate goal for the project would be to find a way to measure the app's effectiveness and integrate Apple's Healthkit to create a model that detects stress. Ideally, I would combine that model with random gif insertions to combat any correlation
			between gifs and stress.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to better define its purpose, functionality, and how the user interacts with the app,
			 I considered what features I wanted to include in this first round:
		<ul class "dots">
			<li> Show entertaining animal gifs at random times during the day.</li>
			<li> The option to dismiss the app or postpone, if user is busy or doesn't want a distraction.</li>
			<li> A way to change the gifs or see more gifs.</li>
			<li> Timeout feature or cap on number of gifs that will prevent the user from wasting too much time.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Initial Mockups</h3>
		<p>After figuring out how the app will be used, I designed some initial mockups.</p>

		<h3>First step</h3>
		<p>So far, I've added a View to the project and changed a bit of the index.ios.js and included a picture of Caveman the Cat.
		The next step is to try to display gifs from giphy which requires a study of the giphy api!</p>
