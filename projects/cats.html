			<h2>React Giphy Cats</h2>
			<h3>In Progress: Swift, React Native</h3>

			<br>
			<p>
				React Giphy Cats is a project I am currently working on using React Native and iOs. The app's goal is to show the user a fun animal gif, at random times throughout the day, to provide a brief distraction and hopefully alleviate some immediate stress.
				I plan on using <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial">this tutorial</a>, as a guide for development. Code progress can be track at
				<a href="https://github.com/MarissaAllen/CatStressApp">this repo.</a></p>
			<p>The ultimate goal for the project would be to find a way to measure the app's effectiveness and integrate Apple's Healthkit to create a model that detects stress. Ideally, I would combine that model with random gif insertions to combat any correlation
				between gifs and stress.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to better define its purpose, functionality, and how the user interacts with the app, I considered what features I wanted to include in this first round:
				<ul class "dots">
					<li> Show entertaining animal gifs at random times during the day.</li>
					<li> The option to dismiss the app or postpone, if user is busy or doesn't want a distraction.</li>
					<li> A way to change the gifs or see more gifs.</li>
					<li> Timeout feature or cap on number of gifs that will prevent the user from wasting too much time.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Initial Mockups</h3>
			<p>After figuring out how the app will be used, I designed some initial mockups. Having the "done" button at the
				top prevents it from accidentally being tapped while the user is swiping through gifs.</p>

			<h3>First step</h3>
			<p>So far, I've added a View to the project and changed a bit of the index.ios.js and included a picture of Caveman the Cat. The next step is to try to display gifs from giphy which requires a study of the giphy api!</p>

			<h3>To Try</h3>
			<p>After reading up on the giphy api and <a href="http://blog.tighten.co/react-101-building-a-gif-search-engine">this tutorial</a>, it seems that I have several options in structuring my app. I could call giphy every time the user swipes to change gifs, I could use the plugin react-giphy
				to make the same call when the user swipes, or I could call giphy once and recieve a list of gifs to iterate through when the user swipes.</p>
			<p>I decided, for my first go-around, to try the third option and structure my app in the following way:</p>
				<ul class "dots">
					<li> Create a separate component/class to load all of the gifs into a list</li>
					<li> Use the size of the list to determine the distraction duration</li>
					<li> Use the a separate gifView to view one gif at a time, iterating through the list</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This should result in quicker iteration through gifs and less wait in-between which suits my needs, because the app should be actively showing gifs for short periodic bursts.</p>
				<h3>Gifs</h3>
				<p>I used SuperAgent to make a request to giphy api and got back a list of gifs matching my search term for cats. So now I need
				to refactor a little bit. I want to make the request right as the app is open, so I need to move it to my index.ios.js file from gifView.
			Then I need to create and update the state of the list and pass it to the gifView. Once this is done I can then pick one gif from the list
			to display. This item will be defined in another file and be changed when the user clicks next.</p>
			<p>So that didn't work. I couldn't find a successful way to pass the gif list to the view using navigatorIOS. So instead of requesting in the index,
			I immediately open the gifView and make a request there. </p>

			<h3>Iterating Through Gifs</h3>
			<p>So it's been a harrowing journey, I've traced through examples trying to figure out how in the world things get called and where they do.
			I still don't know everything, but I now can successfully iterate through a list of gifs and show them from giphy. The trick was that I had
			to map the list, once I requsted it, in order to access the object's url. Now, I just have to check that there is in fact a gif there and not a
			null object before I render the gif in the view.</p>
