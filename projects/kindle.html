			<h2>Kindle Music Holder </h2>
			<h3>Product Design: Solidworks, 3D Printing</h3>
			<img class="photo" src="img/kindle/designInAction.jpg"></img>
		<p>The Dartmouth College Marching Band wanted to use Amazon Kindle Fire
			tablets as music readers instead of paper sheet music. Their original
			solution to attaching these tablets to their instruments was to use velcro
			 to hold the tablets to a thin piece of plastic which then clipped into an
			 instrument lyre. However, the tablets constantly fell off the instrument
			 during marching band performances.
		</p>

		<p>Thatâ€™s where the DALI lab and I came in. The goal of my project was to
			design a tablet mount that utilized the pre-existing instrument lyres
			and securely held a tablet during marching band performances. The design
			had to be capable of expanding to large-scale manufacturing by injection molding.

			<h3>Initial Mockups</h3>

			<h3>Some Prototypes</h3>

		<p> The biggest challenges for the project were ensuring stability while
			simultaneously reducing weight of the tablet holders, warping from the
			lyres, and meeting the injection molding requirements. Eventually, this
			became the base design. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Basic Model</h3>

		<p>The tablet rests on two legs and is secured at the top with inexpensive,
			easily-replaceable rubber bands. However, as you can see in the photo
			below, the mount still required many iterations. In this design, the lyre
			attachment does not conform fully to the lyre, leaving a space that allows
			 it to wobble back and forth. To remedy this and to reduce weight, I
			 created an incline of the lyre profile and adjusted the design to allow
			 the player to attach the lyre to either the front or the back without
			 losing stability</p>

			<h3>Final Model</h3>
		<p>After multiple 3D prototypes and iterations, here is the final model. Its features include multiple holes to adjust for tablet size, an inclined lyre profile for better stability, a raised lyre profile on both the front and the back of the mount for
			versatile lyre placement, an optional thumbscrew to provide tablet angle adjustment, and uniform thickness of the model so that it is completely injection-model ready </p>
