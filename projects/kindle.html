												<h2>Kindle Music Holder </h2>
												<br>
												<h3>Product Design: Solidworks, 3D Printing<h3>
												<img class="photo" src="img/kindle/designInAction.jpg"></img>
											</div>
											<p>The Dartmouth College Marching Band wanted to use Amazon Kindle Fire tablets as music readers instead
												of paper sheet music. Their solution to attaching these tablets to their instruments was
												to use velcro to hold the tablets to a thin piece of plastic which then clipped into an instrument lyre.
												However, the tablets continued to fall off the instrument during marching band performances.
											</p>
											<div class="text-center">
													<img class="photo" src="img/kindle/velcroLyre.jpg"></img>
											</div>
												<p>The goal of this project was to design a tablet mount that utilizes the pre-existing instrument lyres and securely
												holds a tablet during marching band performances. This design had to be capable for expanding to large-scale manufacturing
												by injection molding.
											</p>
											<div class="text-center">
												<h3>Initial Mockups</h3>

											<h3>Some Prototypes</h3>

										<img class="photo" src="img/kindle/impressionProtos.jpg"></img>
										</div>
												<p> There were many challenges, such as stability, weight, warping, and meeting injection molding requirements. One
												problem in particular was ensuring stability while reducing weight. Eventually, this became the base design. </p>
												<div class="text-center">
													<h3>Basic Model</h3>
											<img class="photo" src="img/kindle/basicModel.jpg"></img>
											</div>
												<p>The tablet rests on two legs and is secured at the top with inexpensive, easily-replacable rubber bands. However, as you can see in the photo below, the mount still required many iterations. In this design, the lyre attachment does not conform fully to the lyre,
												leaving a space that allows it to wobble back and forth. To remedy this and to reduce weight,
										I created an incline of the lyre profile and adjusted the design so allow the player to attach the lyre to either
										the front or the back without losing stability.</p>
										<div class="text-center">

									</div>
												<p>After multiple 3D prototypes and iterations, here is the final model. Its features include multiple holes to adjust for tablet size,
												an inclined lyre profile for better stability, a raised lyre profile on both the front and the back of the mount for versatile
												 lyre placement, an optional thumbscrew to provide tablet angle adjustment, and uniform thickness of the model
												 so that it is completely injection-model ready  </p>
